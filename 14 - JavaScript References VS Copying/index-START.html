    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Johnny';
    console.log(players, team);
    // we updated team but team is not an array.
    // team is a just reference to the original
    // array which is players. so when you edit that
    // original array or when you update any of the arrays,
    // it is always going to back to the reference where it
    // was which is not the same as what we did here with numbers, strings.

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 20 })
    console.log(captain2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const captain3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const mark = {
      name: 'mark',
      age: 22,
      social: {
        twitter: "nct",
        instagram: "nct u"
      }
    };
    console.log(mark);

    const ten = Object.assign({}, mark); //copy mark object, but it's only copy first hash. not the second(twitter, instagram)
    const johnny = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(mark)); //copy of all the object.
